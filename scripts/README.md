# Scripts

- `bootstrap_local.sh`: install baseline dependencies for frontend and backend.
- `run_local_checks.sh`: orchestrate lint/build/test steps for all subsystems.

Add further helper scripts (smoke tests, data backfills, release utilities) as
you refine the manual workflow. Keep scripts idempotent and document required
environment variables.
