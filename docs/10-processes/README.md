# Manual Processes

- `development.md`: day-to-day development workflow.
- `qa-checklist.md`: verification steps before releases.
- `release.md`: deployment/runbook with rollback instructions.

Update these documents whenever the workflow changes. Without CI/CD, they are the
single source of truth for operational readiness.
