# Documentation Index

- `00-blueprints/`: planning notes and migration strategy.
- `10-processes/`: manual workflows replacing CI/CD.
- `20-reference/`: canonical product documentation.
- `30-decisions/`: architecture decisions, risk logs, retrospectives.

Keep this tree lightweight. Drafts should live under `00-blueprints/` until they
are ratified and moved to the reference or process sections.
