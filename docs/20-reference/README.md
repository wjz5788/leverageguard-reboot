# Reference Library

This section gathers stable reference documents migrated from the legacy
repository:
- `LiqPass_HelpDoc_CN.md`
- `LiqPass_HelpDoc_EN.md`
- `references.md`
- `proof.md`

Keep canonical product documentation here. New proposals or drafts go into
`docs/00-blueprints/` until they are ratified.
