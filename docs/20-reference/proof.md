# LiqPass Proof & Verification Playbook

This note explains how reviewers can reconcile offline evidence with on-chain artefacts published by the LiqPass team. The procedure covers three layers: documentation fingerprints, smart-contract provenance, and operational event trails.

## 1. Documentation Fingerprints
1. All externally shared PDFs (help docs, pitch slides, financial summaries) include a SHA-256 digest in the document footer.
2. The canonical source files live in this repository under `docs/`. Run `shasum -a 256 <file>` and compare with the digest listed in the external facing material.
3. Any translated version carries the same digest in an appendix so reviewers can cross-check content consistency.

## 2. Smart Contract Provenance
- Canonical Base mainnet contract address: `0x9552b58d323993f84d01e3744f175f47a9462f94`.
- Deployment transaction: https://basescan.org/tx/0xb2f9d24f06bcdb81f87edb0f242dbe7f0c2410f1ae4270db0f4f4a2a1eb84252
- Verified source: https://basescan.org/address/0x9552b58d323993f84d01e3744f175f47a9462f94#code

Verification steps:
1. Fetch the deployment bytecode from BaseScan and compare with the bytecode generated by `forge build` in `contracts/`.
2. Run `forge verify-contract` using the stored API key (handled offline) to reproduce the verified metadata.
3. Cross-check emitted events with the historical ledger exported under `data/onchain/liqpass_events.csv`.

## 3. Insurance Policy & Payout Log
1. Every issued protection ticket hashes policy metadata (`user address`, `cex_uid`, `max_coverage`, `expiry`, `premium_paid`, `nonce`).
2. The hash is published via `ProtectionIssued` event; staff keeps an offline registry at `data/policies/issued.csv`.
3. When a payout occurs, the script `src/ops/liqpass_payout_recorder.py` pushes a new `PayoutSettled` event referencing the policy hash. Reviewers can diff the CSV with on-chain logs.

## 4. Off-Chain Storage Integrity
- Encrypted artefacts (cex margin screenshots, bank receipts) live in a Vaultwarden instance. Each item carries the same SHA-256 hash recorded in `data/audit/checklist.yml`.
- During onsite review, the team unlocks the vault and allows auditors to recompute the hashes locally.

## 5. Contact for Escalation
- Security desk: security@wjz5788.com (PGP fingerprint `236A 4E7D 9C67 82BE 1D0F  420E 8B01 1F90 C8D5 6A96`).

> The goal is to offer deterministic, scriptable verification so Base Ecosystem Fund reviewers can audit claims without depending on proprietary infrastructure.
